""" Line 15 replaces all whitespaces (which are symbols) with a capital A. Since on line 14 the program has
 already made the original contents of the string all lowercase, we can easily identify capital A's as something that
 needs to be removed later on """

""" We can now check to see if the contents of the string are only part of the alphabet on line 17, and then simply
change our capital A's back into whitespaces again"""
